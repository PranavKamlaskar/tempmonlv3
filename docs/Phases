suggest me a Iot devops project ,
the project should be devops centered ,  basic flask app  nothing fancy at all I am not a developer 
my devops skills should elevate , terraform , jenkins ansible , kubernetes minikube , prometheys and grafana , postgres
uno and esp8266,
NO DOCKER
the whole devops thing will be done in a gcp vm 
SImple dashboard with some useful buttons

Here’s a great IoT DevOps-centered project that fits your requirements exactly:
🔧 Project Title: IoT Device Monitor & Controller with DevOps Pipeline (NO Docker)
🎯 Project Goal:
Create a simple Flask web dashboard hosted on a GCP VM to:

Monitor data from an ESP8266/UNO sensor (e.g., temperature, humidity).

Control an output (like an LED or relay) via button(s) on the dashboard.

Use DevOps tools (Terraform, Jenkins, Ansible, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana) to deploy, manage, monitor the system.

NO Docker, but Kubernetes with Minikube for practicing infrastructure-as-code and orchestration.

                          [Flask Web Dashboard]
                                   |
                   [Control: Turn LED on/off via HTTP to ESP]
                                   |
           [Monitored by: Prometheus + Grafana in Minikube]
💡 What You’ll Build:
1. IoT Firmware (ESP8266 + Arduino UNO):
Read sensor data (e.g., temperature from DHT11).

Send data via HTTP POST to Flask endpoint.

Accept simple ON/OFF commands from Flask (to control a GPIO pin).

2. Flask Web App:
Minimal dashboard:

Show sensor values from Postgres.

Buttons to send "ON/OFF" command to ESP8266.

Flask API:

/data for ESP to POST sensor data.

/control for dashboard to send control signal.

3. Postgres Database:
Store incoming data (timestamp, sensor_type, value).

⚙️ DevOps Components:
Tool	Usage
Terraform	Provision GCP VM, networking, and static IP
Ansible	Set up Postgres, Python, Flask, and any system dependencies
Jenkins	CI/CD: Pull Flask app code from GitHub, restart service, run tests
Kubernetes (Minikube)	Deploy Flask and monitoring stack on GCP VM (no Docker!)
Prometheus	Monitor Flask app, track uptime, response time, errors
Grafana	Visualize sensor data and system metrics

📋 Steps Breakdown:
IoT Device Setup:

Program ESP8266 to read data and make HTTP requests.

Serve as Wi-Fi client to communicate with Flask API.

Flask App:

Basic routes: /, /data, /control.

Insert incoming data into Postgres.

Control buttons (send simple HTTP GET/POST to ESP).

DevOps Setup:

Use Terraform to provision the VM.

Use Ansible to configure VM (install Python, Flask, Postgres).

Use Jenkins to deploy Flask app from GitHub and restart it on code push.

Set up Minikube on GCP VM and deploy Flask app and monitoring stack to it.

Use Prometheus Exporters for Flask (e.g., prometheus_flask_exporter).

Configure Grafana dashboards for metrics and sensor values.

✅ Why This Project?
Uses your hardware (ESP8266/UNO).

Simple non-developer-friendly Flask app.

Focus is fully on DevOps.

Real-world DevOps stack on cloud VM, with IaC, CI/CD, monitoring.

Avoids Docker, uses K8s and systemd/app-based deployment.

Absolutely! Here's a phase-wise breakdown of the project to help you stay organized and focus on one step at a time.

🔄 PHASE-WISE BREAKDOWN: IoT DevOps Project
🧱 Phase 1: Hardware & Local Testing
Goal: Get your ESP8266 + UNO + sensor working and communicating with a basic Flask server.

Tasks:
Wire up DHT11 sensor (or similar) to ESP8266.

Program ESP8266 to:

Read sensor data.

Send it via HTTP POST to a local Flask endpoint.

Accept and respond to control commands (ON/OFF).

Run a local Flask app on your laptop with:

/data POST route.

/control GET/POST to send commands.

✅ Deliverable: Local sensor data visible on Flask + control buttons working.

🌐 Phase 2: GCP VM Provisioning with Terraform
Goal: Automate the creation of a VM on GCP.

Tasks:
Write Terraform code to:

Spin up a GCP Compute Engine instance (Ubuntu preferred).

Add firewall rules for HTTP, SSH.

Apply the Terraform config.

✅ Deliverable: VM running on GCP with a public IP.

🛠 Phase 3: Server Provisioning with Ansible
Goal: Automatically configure the VM.

Tasks:
Write Ansible playbooks to:

Install Python, pip, Flask.

Install and configure PostgreSQL.

Set up Git, Nginx (optional), required systemd services.

Deploy the Flask app as a system service (flask.service with ExecStart).

✅ Deliverable: Flask + Postgres running on GCP with data from ESP appearing.

🚀 Phase 4: CI/CD with Jenkins
Goal: Set up automatic deployment pipeline for Flask app.

Tasks:
Install Jenkins (manually or via Ansible).

Create a GitHub repo for the Flask app.

Create Jenkins pipeline:

Pull latest code from GitHub.

Run basic lint/test (optional).

Restart Flask systemd service.

✅ Deliverable: Code push auto-deploys to GCP Flask server.

📦 Phase 5: Kubernetes with Minikube (No Docker)
Goal: Run your Flask app inside Kubernetes (with native Python packaging).

Tasks:
Install Minikube on GCP VM.

Write YAML manifests for:

Flask app Deployment + Service.

Postgres (or use external Postgres).

Use hostPath or external services since no Docker is involved.

✅ Deliverable: Flask running in Minikube, accessible via NodePort or Ingress.

📊 Phase 6: Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana
Goal: Observe system + app health.

Tasks:
Deploy Prometheus + Grafana in Minikube (Helm or YAML).

Use prometheus_flask_exporter in Flask app.

Create custom Grafana dashboards:

Flask uptime, requests, errors.

Sensor values over time (from Postgres or metrics).

✅ Deliverable: Live dashboard with app and sensor health stats.

🧪 Phase 7: Final Integration & Testing
Goal: Ensure everything is tied together and resilient.

Tasks:
Test full data flow:

ESP -> Flask -> Postgres -> Grafana

Test control:

Button -> Flask -> ESP

Reboot system, test persistence.

Secure endpoints (optional).

✅ Deliverable: Fully functional and self-healing IoT DevOps pipeline.
